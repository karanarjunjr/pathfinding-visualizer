# Pathfinding Visualizer
I have always wished to recreate the Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer and finally got some good time to do the same. Visualizing algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm can be difficult and that's where this web-application helps.

## Here are a few snapshots
### Before visualization:

### After the path is found:

## Algorithms
1) Dijsktra - Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

2) DFS - Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

3) BFS - Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses the opposite strategy of depth-first search, which instead explores the node branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and expand other nodes.



# Getting Started/Installation
Pretty much the same as the standard react application, so all the usual react-scripts are available to your disposal. So, over here I restricted myself to the instructions to only the essentials.
## 1. Clone the repository or download the zip
```
git clone https://github.com/karanarjunjr/pathfinding-visualizer.git
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

## 3. Start the application
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
